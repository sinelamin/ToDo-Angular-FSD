# ToDoProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.9.

## Description

This is a ToDo project developed as a pet project to practice working with Angular 17 and Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture. In this project, I am using Taiga UI for creating a user-friendly and modern interface. The backend is powered by a Strapi API, which is run locally.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Set up Strapi:

Ensure that Strapi is installed and running on your machine. You can follow the Strapi documentation for installation instructions.
Create a new Strapi project and set up the necessary API collections for managing tasks.
Make sure Strapi is running on the expected port (default is 1337).

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
